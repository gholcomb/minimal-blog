    "content": "For years, economists and wealth managers have pointed to a looming shift they’ve dubbed The Great Wealth Transfer: the projected $70+ trillion that Baby Boomers and Gen X will eventually pass down to younger generations.\n\nIt’s not a future event. It’s already happening. And it’s not happening through wills, trusts, or estate lawyers. It’s happening quietly, privately, and increasingly through one of the most important financial decisions a young adult can make: buying a home.\n\n### 👪 “Nepo Buyers” and the Rise of Family-Funded Homeownership\nIn 2019, about 18% of Millennial homebuyers received a gift or inheritance to help with a down payment. By 2025, that number has grown to nearly 1 in 4 across Millennials and Gen Z and up to 38% among Gen Z first-time buyers.\n\nWe’re witnessing the emergence of what some call the “nepo-buyer”: young adults breaking into homeownership with the backing of their parents, whether through gifts, low-interest loans, or co-signed mortgages.\n\n### 📈 How It Will Help (and Hurt) the Housing Market\n\n✅ How It Helps:\n\n- **Sustains demand**: In high-rate environments, family-backed buyers keep deals moving that otherwise wouldn’t happen.\n- **Supports price floors**: More liquidity in the market especially in the first-time buyer segment prevents steep price corrections.\n- **Smooths generational transitions**: Older homeowners can downsize, while younger ones buy in, supporting housing turnover.\n\n❌ How It Hurts:\n\n- **Drives up prices**: Cash-infused buyers can offer more, pricing out those without help especially in entry-level segments.\n- **Widens inequality**: The market increasingly favors the \"already resourced,\" deepening affordability issues.\n- **Undermines policy effectiveness**: Traditional housing incentives (like tax credits or rate buydowns) lose power when parental wealth becomes the real gatekeeper.\n\nThe Great Wealth Transfer won’t arrive all at once in the form of inheritance windfalls. It’s coming bit by bit, deal by deal, as older generations quietly support younger ones with major financial milestones.",
